Problem-1: Clustering
A leading bank wants to develop a customer segmentation to give promotional offers to its customers. A sample data set of 210 customers has been collected
that summarizes their activities over the past few months. The task on hand is to identify various segments of customers based on credit card usage and to profile
them, so as to provide a sound basis for differentiated campaigns / targeted activities in future.


Problem-2: CART, Random Forest and Neural Networks
An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management wants to be able to predict claim generation in an efficient manner.
So, based on data from the past few years and with the help of Classificaton models namely Decision Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Neural
Networks (NN), a dependable model for claim prediction needs to be worked out.
